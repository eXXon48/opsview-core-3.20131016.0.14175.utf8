This directory holds image files used by Opsview.

These files are generated from source files held in 
an Opsview asset repository, but are stored here for packaging.

There are 3 types of images, in subdirectories:
  * icons      - fixed size images used as icons
  * host icons - aka logos, for icons of a host type
  * images     - other image files, mainly of irregular shape for layout or other purposes

Run "make install" to copy into /usr/local/nagios/share/images.
Host icons are installed into /usr/local/nagios/share/images/logos.
We do not use gd2 files for host icons, for simplicity.

Note: some images may initially be from 3rd parties for testing purposes, 
but the latest versions will be Opsview copyright files
