# SYNTAX:
# 	nagconfgen {-s file | [-t] {path to write}} [monitoringserver_id]
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# 	Nagios config generator
# 	Reads the database information and creates the nagios configuration files
#	-s means only write only the snmp trapinfo into file
#	-t means test output. Avoids hostname lookups and nagiosgraph icons
#	If monitoringserver_id is set, will create the config for just that monitoringserver

# PHYSICAL HTML PATH
# This is the path where the HTML files for Nagios reside.  This

# and statuswrl CGIs.

physical_html_path=/usr/local/nagios/share



# URL HTML PATH
# This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
# physical location of the Nagios HTML files (as defined above).
# This value is used by the CGIs to locate the online documentation
# and graphics.  If you access the Nagios pages with an URL like
# http://www.myhost.com/nagios, this value should be '/nagios'
# (without the quotes).
# NOTE: This value is generated by Opsview

url_html_path=%URL_HTML_PATH%



# CONTEXT-SENSITIVE HELP
# This option determines whether or not a context-sensitive
# help icon will be displayed for most of the CGIs.
# Values: 0 = disables context-sensitive help
#         1 = enables context-sensitive help

show_context_help=0



# PENDING STATES OPTION
# This option determines what states should be displayed in the web
# interface for hosts/services that have not yet been checked.
# Values: 0 = leave hosts/services that have not been check yet in their original state
#         1 = mark hosts/services that have not been checked yet as PENDING

# AUTHENTICATION USAGE
# This option controls whether or not the CGIs will use any
# authentication when displaying host and service information, as
# well as committing commands to Nagios for processing.
#
# Read the HTML documentation to learn how the authorization works!
#
# NOTE: It is a really *bad* idea to disable authorization, unless
# you plan on removing the command CGI (cmd.cgi)!  Failure to do
# so will leave you wide open to kiddies messing with Nagios and
# possibly hitting you with a denial of service attack by filling up
# your drive by continuously writing to your command file!
#
# Setting this value to 0 will cause the CGIs to *not* use
# authentication (bad idea), while any other value will make them
# use the authentication functions (the default).

use_authentication=1



# DEFAULT USER
# Setting this variable will define a default user name that can
# access pages without authentication.  This allows people within a
# secure domain (i.e., behind a firewall) to see the current status
# without authenticating.  You may want to use this to avoid basic
# authentication if you are not using a secure server since basic
# authentication transmits passwords in the clear.
#
# Important:  Do not define a default username unless you are
# running a secure web server and are sure that everyone who has
# access to the CGIs has been authenticated in some manner!  If you
# define this variable, anyone who has not authenticated to the web
# server will inherit all rights you assign to this user!

#default_user_name=guest



# SYSTEM/PROCESS INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# have access to viewing the Nagios process information as
# provided by the Extended Information CGI (extinfo.cgi).  By
# default, *no one* has access to this unless you choose to
# not use authorization.  You may use an asterisk (*) to
# authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.

authorized_for_system_information=%ADMINS%



# CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can view ALL configuration information (hosts, commands, etc).

# for the hosts and services they are contacts for. You may use
# an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has authenticated
# to the web server.

authorized_for_configuration_information=%ADMINS%



# SYSTEM/PROCESS COMMAND ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can issue shutdown and restart commands to Nagios via the
# command CGI (cmd.cgi).  Users in this list can also change
# the program mode to active or standby. By default, *no one*
# has access to this unless you choose to not use authorization.

# STATUSMAP BACKGROUND IMAGE
# This option allows you to specify an image to be used as a
# background in the statusmap CGI.  It is assumed that the image
# resides in the HTML images path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share/images).
# This path is automatically determined by appending "/images"
# to the path specified by the 'physical_html_path' directive.
# Note:  The image file may be in GIF, PNG, JPEG, or GD2 format.
# However, I recommend that you convert your image to GD2 format
# (uncompressed), as this will cause less CPU load when the CGI
# generates the image.

#statusmap_background_image=smbackground.gd2



# DEFAULT STATUSMAP LAYOUT METHOD
# This option allows you to specify the default layout method
# the statusmap CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you do
# not use this option, the default is to use user-defined
# coordinates.  Valid options are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#	1 = Depth layers
#       2 = Collapsed tree
#       3 = Balanced tree
#       4 = Circular
#       5 = Circular (Marked Up)

# DEFAULT STATUSWRL LAYOUT METHOD
# This option allows you to specify the default layout method
# the statuswrl (VRML) CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you
# do not use this option, the default is to use user-defined
# coordinates.  Valid options are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#       2 = Collapsed tree
#       3 = Balanced tree
#       4 = Circular

# generated VRML world.  It is assumed that the file
# resides in the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share).

#statuswrl_include=myworld.wrl



# PING SYNTAX
# This option determines what syntax should be used when
# attempting to ping a host from the WAP interface (using
# the statuswml CGI.  You must include the full path to
# the ping binary, along with all required options.  The
# $HOSTADDRESS$ macro is substituted with the address of
# the host before the command is executed.
# Please note that the syntax for the ping binary is
# notorious for being different on virtually ever *NIX
# OS and distribution, so you may have to tweak this to
# work on your system.

ping_syntax=/bin/ping -n -U -c 5 $HOSTADDRESS$



# REFRESH RATE
# This option allows you to specify the refresh rate in seconds
# of various CGIs (status, statusmap, extinfo, and outages).

refresh_rate=%REFRESH_RATE%



# ESCAPE HTML TAGS
# This option determines whether HTML tags in host and service
# status output is escaped in the web interface.  If enabled,
# your plugin output will not be able to contain clickable links.

escape_html_tags=1




# SOUND OPTIONS
# These options allow you to specify an optional audio file
# that should be played in your browser window when there are
# problems on the network.  The audio files are used only in
# the status CGI.  Only the sound for the most critical problem
# will be played.  Order of importance (higher to lower) is as
# follows: unreachable hosts, down hosts, critical services,
# warning services, and unknown services. If there are no
# visible problems, the sound file optionally specified by
# 'normal_sound' variable will be played.
#
#
# <varname>=<sound_file>
#
# Note: All audio files must be placed in the /media subdirectory
# under the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share/media/).

# URL TARGET FRAMES
# These options determine the target frames in which notes and
# action URLs will open.

action_url_target=_blank

# LOCK AUTHOR NAMES OPTION
# This option determines whether users can change the author name
# when submitting comments, scheduling downtime.  If disabled, the

# OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE(S)
# This is the configuration file in which you define hosts, host
# groups, contacts, contact groups, services, etc.  I guess it would
# be better called an object definition file, but for historical
# reasons it isn't.  You can split object definitions into several
# different config files by using multiple cfg_file statements here.
# Nagios will read and process all the config files you define.
# This can be very useful if you want to keep command definitions
# separate from host and contact definitions...

# Plugin commands (service and host check commands)
# Arguments are likely to change between different releases of the
# plugins, so you should use the same config file provided with the
# plugin release rather than the one provided with Nagios.

# OBJECT CACHE FILE
# This option determines where object definitions are cached when
# Nagios starts/restarts.  The CGIs read object definitions from

# directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur
# when the config files are modified after Nagios starts.

object_cache_file=%OBJECT_CACHE_FILE%



# PRE-CACHED OBJECT FILE
# This options determines the location of the precached object file.
# If you run Nagios with the -p command line option, it will preprocess
# your object configuration file(s) and write the cached config to this
# file.  You can then start Nagios with the -u option to have it read
# object definitions from this precached file, rather than the standard
# object configuration files (see the cfg_file and cfg_dir options above).
# Using a precached object file can speed up the time needed to (re)start
# the Nagios process if you've got a large and/or complex configuration.
# Read the documentation section on optimizing Nagios to find our more
# about how this feature works.

# RESOURCE FILE
# This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro

# multiple resource_file definitions.  The CGIs will not attempt to
# read the contents of resource files, so information that is
# considered to be sensitive (usernames, passwords, etc) can be
# defined as macros in this file and restrictive permissions (600)
# can be placed on this file.

# DAEMON CORE DUMP OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios is allowed to create
# a core dump when it runs as a daemon.  Note that it is generally
# considered bad form to allow this, but it may be useful for
# debugging purposes.  Enabling this option doesn't guarantee that
# a core file will be produced, but that's just life...
# Values: 1 - Allow core dumps
#         0 - Do not allow core dumps (default)

daemon_dumps_core=%DAEMON_DUMPS_CORE%



# LARGE INSTALLATION TWEAKS OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will take some shortcuts
# which can save on memory and CPU usage in large Nagios installations.
# Read the documentation for more information on the benefits/tradeoffs
# of enabling this option.
# Values: 1 - Enabled tweaks
#         0 - Disable tweaks (default)

# ENABLE ENVIRONMENT MACROS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will make all standard
# macros available as environment variables when host/service checks
# and system commands (event handlers, notifications, etc.) are
# executed.  Enabling this option can cause performance issues in
# large installations, as it will consume a bit more memory and (more
# importantly) consume more CPU.
# Values: 1 - Enable environment variable macros (default)
#         0 - Disable environment variable macros

enable_environment_macros=1



# CHILD PROCESS MEMORY OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will free memory in
# child processes (processed used to execute system commands and host/
# service checks).  If you specify a value here, it will override
# program defaults.
# Value: 1 - Free memory in child processes
#        0 - Do not free memory in child processes

#free_child_process_memory=1



# CHILD PROCESS FORKING BEHAVIOR
# This option determines how Nagios will fork child processes
# (used to execute system commands and host/service checks).  Normally
# child processes are fork()ed twice, which provides a very high level
# of isolation from problems.  Fork()ing once is probably enough and will
# save a great deal on CPU usage (in large installs), so you might
# want to consider using this.  If you specify a value here, it will
# program defaults.
# Value: 1 - Child processes fork() twice
#        0 - Child processes fork() just once

#child_processes_fork_twice=1



# DEBUG LEVEL
# This option determines how much (if any) debugging information will
# be written to the debug file.  OR values together to log multiple
# types of information.
# Values:
#          -1 = Everything

## TABLE TRIMMING OPTIONS
# Several database tables containing Nagios event data can become quite large
# over time.  Most admins will want to trim these tables and keep only a
# certain amount of data in them.  The options below are used to specify the
# age (in MINUTES) that data should be allowd to remain in various tables
# before it is deleted.  Using a value of zero (0) for any value means that
# that particular table should NOT be automatically trimmed.

#   file       = standard text file
#   tcpsocket  = TCP socket
#   unixsocket = UNIX domain socket (default)

# OUTPUT
# This option determines the name and path of the file or UNIX domain
# socket to which output will be sent if the output type option specified
# above is "file" or "unixsocket", respectively.  If the output type
# option is "tcpsocket", this option is used to specify the IP address

# option specified above is "tcpsocket".

tcp_port=5668



# OUTPUT BUFFER
# This option determines the size of the output buffer, which will help
# prevent data from getting lost if there is a temporary disconnect from
# the data sink.  The number of items specified here is the number of
# lines (each of variable size) of output that will be buffered.

output_buffer_items=5000



# BUFFER FILE
# This option is used to specify a file which will be used to store the
# contents of buffered data which could not be sent to the NDO2DB daemon
# before Nagios shuts down.  Prior to shutting down, the NDO NEB module
# will write all buffered data to this file for later processing.  When
# Nagios (re)starts, the NDO NEB module will read the contents of this
# file and send it to the NDO2DB daemon for processing.

# FILE ROTATION INTERVAL
# This option determines how often (in seconds) the output file is

# option has no effect if the output_type option is a socket.

file_rotation_interval=5



# FILE ROTATION COMMAND
# This option specified the command (as defined in Nagios) that is
# used to rotate the output file at the interval specified by the
# file_rotation_interval option.  This option has no effect if the
# output_type option is a socket.
#
# See the file 'misccommands.cfg' for an example command definition
# that you can use to rotate the log file.

# FILE ROTATION TIMEOUT
# This option specified the maximum number of seconds that the file
# rotation command should be allowed to run before being prematurely
# terminated.

file_rotation_timeout=10



# RECONNECT INTERVAL
# This option determines how often (in seconds) that the NDBXT NEB
# module will attempt to re-connect to the output file or socket if
# a connection to it is lost.

reconnect_interval=15



# RECONNECT WARNING INTERVAL
# This option determines how often (in seconds) a warning message will
# be logged to the Nagios log file if a connection to the output file
# or socket cannot be re-established.

#reconnect_warning_interval=900



# DATA PROCESSING OPTION
# This option determines what data the NDBXT NEB module will process.
# Do not mess with this option unless you know what you're doing!!!!
# Read the source code (include/ndbxtmod.h) to determine what values
# to use here.  Values from source code should be OR'ed to get the
# value to use here.  A value of -1 will cause all data to be processed.

#data_processing_options=-1
# All except external commands. We still need it at broker level for altinity_distributed_commands
# See include/ndomod.h for how to calculate
data_processing_options=66977791



# CONFIG OUTPUT OPTION
# This option determines what types of configuration data the NDBXT
# NEB module will dump from Nagios.  Values can be OR'ed together.
# Values: 0 = Don't dump anything
#         1 = Dump original config (from config files)
#         2 = Dump config after retained information has been restored
